## Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project Read Me

Intention of course project is to demonstrate ability to retrieve data and
perform clean up to provide a tidy data set for analysis.

This repro contains this README file, and CookBook file explaining the data, variables, and transformations
performed, and the runanalysis.R script that takes the input data and returns the tidy data set.

Input data is retrieved from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

More information on this input data was provided from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

Again the intention of the project is to demonstrate abiltiy to get and clean data.  Some of the operations
to the data may not make sense for the specific research of the intial data, but the essence of the assignment 
is to take input data and provide a tidy data set.  Therefore some liberties were taken with what data was 
selected for the tidy data set.
